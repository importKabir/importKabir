# 💫 About Me

Hi, I'm **Kabir Shukla** 👋  

I like building things where **natural language, code, and AI** meet—tools that let you describe what you want and get working software or insights back.  

Lately, I’ve been exploring:
- **AI code generation & agents** – using LLMs to understand intent, generate codebases, and automate developer workflows  
- **End-to-end prototypes** – from prompt → reasoning → code → usable app  
- **Practical ML** – models and experiments that are simple enough to ship, but powerful enough to be useful  

I enjoy iterating fast, breaking ideas into experiments, and then polishing what works into something others can actually use.

Always open to collaborating on projects where **AI is central to the product experience**, not just a checkbox feature.
