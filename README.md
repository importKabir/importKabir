# 💫 About Me

Hi, I'm **Kabir Shukla** 👋  

I like building things where **natural language, code, and AI** meet—tools that let you describe what you want and get working software or insights back.  

Lately, I’ve been exploring:
- **AI code generation & agents** – using LLMs to understand intent, generate codebases, and automate developer workflows  
- **End-to-end prototypes** – from prompt → reasoning → code → usable app  
- **Practical ML** – models and experiments that are simple enough to ship, but powerful enough to be useful  

I enjoy iterating fast, breaking ideas into experiments, and then polishing what works into something others can actually use.

Always open to collaborating on projects where **AI is central to the product experience**, not just a checkbox feature.

## 🔧 Highlight Project – Code-Genie

> **Code-Genie** is an AI-powered code generation tool that turns natural language prompts into functional, ready-to-use codebases.

- Takes a **plain English description** of what you want to build and generates structured project code  
- Uses **LLM-based generation** to create boilerplate, core logic, and file structure so you can start from a working base instead of a blank file  
- Designed as a smaller, experimental cousin to tools like Lovable—focused on learning how to wire **prompts → reasoning → code** in a repeatable way
